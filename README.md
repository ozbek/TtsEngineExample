TtsEngineExample
================

This is an example TTS Engine that breaks Settings app in Android 4.4.2 (aka KitKat)

The original source is copied from {ANDROID-SDK}/samples/android-19/legacy/TtsEngine

Please note that installing this engine and setting default language to 'uzbek' will break
Text-to-speech output settings permanently that can be fixed only by factory resetting the device
(unless rooted).
